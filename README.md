http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17705781/video-delay-buffer-in-processing-2-0

videoDelay_mouseNavigate uses mouse's X coordinate to change the playback point in the buffer array.

videoDelay_faceTrack uses atduskgreg's open-cv-processing library to set the playback point in the buffer from the face's X coordinate.
